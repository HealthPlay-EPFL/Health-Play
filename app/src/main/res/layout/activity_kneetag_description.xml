\n
Kneetag is a physical duel where each player has to touch his opponent's knee before his gets touched.\n
Standing with their feet about shoulder-width apart, each person faces their partner about a metre away and bends down slightly to place their hands on their knees.\n
Each fighter eyes the other eagerly and on “GO” the action begins.\n
A round lasts no more than 20-30 seconds. The person who scores the most ‘tags’ upon their partner’s knees wins. Start a new round, or swap partners.\n
Capture your fight with your phone to have a fair referee or in case you don't have a third player.\n
